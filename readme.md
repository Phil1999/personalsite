# Personal Site

## **Motivation**
I wanted to create a website where people could easily take a glance and see the projects i've been working on and provide an easy way to contact me. 

My vision for the website was to create something very minimal, without unnecessary responsive elements and where the important bits are shown clearly to the viewer.

## **Technologies used**
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Bootstrap
